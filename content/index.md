## Races
I love writing races - or species as they call them now - and generally love to focus on the large aspect of races. Wizards of the Coast is a company full of cowards an thieves. 

So, instead of waiting for them to make truly large races, I will make them myself. 

Be aware, I do not exclusively write large races.  

##### Large Races
Large races all follow a specific set of rules which will be referenced in each of the individual races page. 
1. [[Urseinen]] (Bear Folk)
2. [[Half-Giant]] 
3. [[Treeant]]
4. [[Minotaur]]
5. [[Orc]]
6. [[Ogre ]]
