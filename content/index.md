## Races
I love writing races - or species as they call them now - and generally love to focus on the large aspect of races. Wizards of the Coast is a company full of cowards an thieves. 

So, instead of waiting for them to make truly large races, I will make them myself. 

Be aware, I do not exclusively write large races.  

### Large Races
Large races all follow a specific set of rules which will be referenced in each of the individual races page.
