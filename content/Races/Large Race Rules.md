### More Mass, More Clumsy:
As a large race, you are capable of carrying much more. Because of this, you can increase your Strength Score beyond 20, to 22. However, your Dexterity Score cannot surpass 18. In addition, you naturally have a +1 to Strength, and a -1 to Dexterity. 
### Bigger Target:
Because you are larger, it makes you easier to hit. Because of this, you calculate all Armor Class as 9 + bonuses. 
### Larger Body, Larger Armor:
Because you are larger than most, you require much more material to make your weapons and armor. All gear that is warn by you costs 4 times it's original amount. (This does not apply to magical gear)
### Large Arms:
You can use large weapons. These weapons have a bonus damage dice of 1d4. This additional damage is either the weapons damage dice, or bludgeoning (unless ranged). These weapons cost 4 times the original amount. (This does not apply to magical weapons)
### Attack Range:
To spare some balance to the game, your reach does not extend to 10 feet (unless your race gives you that). Because of this, you only have a natural 5 foot reach.
