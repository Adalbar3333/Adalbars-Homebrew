# The Cult of Syllanaxen: An Overview

The Cult of Syllanaxen, dedicated to the god of Evil, Chaos, and Destruction, operates in the shadows, spreading fear and chaos. They are an extremist organization, widely feared and despised for their violent methods and fanaticism. The cult believes that Syllanaxen’s dismembered body, scattered across the world, holds the key to unlocking his full power. By collecting these parts, cultists can gain immense abilities and bring about a new age of chaos, destruction, and absolute power under Syllanaxen’s rule.

## The Body of Syllanaxen

According to cult legend, Syllanaxen was once a mighty god who, in a cosmic battle, was defeated and his body torn apart, each piece holding a fragment of his dark power. These parts were hidden across the world by other deities to prevent Syllanaxen's return. The cult believes that reuniting these parts will allow Syllanaxen to return, bringing with him an era of darkness.

The body parts of Syllanaxen are not just inert pieces of flesh but powerful artifacts that can be used by those who manage to attune to them. Each part grants the user potent abilities that reflect the chaotic and destructive nature of Syllanaxen.

### Parts of Syllanaxen and Their Abilities

1. **The Claw**: The Claw is a symbol of Syllanaxen’s wrath and offensive might. Possessing one grants the user exceptional combat abilities, allowing them to channel necrotic energy into their attacks. The necrotic damage scales with the user’s power, making the Claw a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled cultist. In addition to raw damage, the Claw allows its user to strike with finesse, bypassing the need for brute strength or agility. Instead, the user can channel their spellcasting prowess into physical attacks, making even the most mundane strike a deadly encounter.  
	> The Claws Effects:
	> - You deal an additional 1d10 Necrotic damage
	> - When you wield a weapon that does not have the Heavy, Two-Handed, or Reach property, you can use your Spell Casting Modifier instead. If the weapon does not have the finesse property, it does while you are wielding it. 
	> - For each claw you poses, you deal an additional 1d10 necrotic damage.

   **Quantities and Effects**: There are 20 Claws scattered throughout the world. Cultists who possess more than one Claw can stack their benefits, increasing the necrotic damage output or even adding effects like causing paralysis or severe decay. Theoretically, a cultist could wield multiple Claws, each enhancing their destructive potential, but the physical and spiritual strain of doing so often leads to madness or death.

2. **The Scale**: Representing Syllanaxen’s resilience, the Scale grants its wearer a durable, almost impenetrable defense. It not only offers resistance to necrotic damage, reflecting Syllanaxen’s own affinity with death and decay, but also enhances the wearer’s natural armor, making them tough opponents in battle. The Scale integrates with the user’s body, forming a tough, scaly hide that protects against both magical and physical attacks.
	> ##### Effects of the Scales:
	> - You gain a +1 to your AC
	> - You gain resistance to Necrotic Damage
	> 	5. You gain immunity to Necrotic Damage when you attune to 5 scales. 
	> 	10. You gain immunity to non-magical Physical Damage
	> For each scale you are attuned to, you gain a +1 to your Armor Class (Unarmored or Armored) to a maximum of +10
	
   **Quantities and Effects**: With 250 Scales available, they are the most common of Syllanaxen’s parts. Cultists with multiple Scales can layer them, enhancing their armor class further and making them nearly invulnerable to certain types of damage. Overuse of Scales, however, leads to a grotesque transformation, where the user’s body becomes reptilian, hard, and cold, leading to physical and emotional detachment from humanity.

3. **The Fang**: A symbol of Syllanaxen’s savagery, the Fang transforms its user into a living weapon, granting a vicious bite attack. This bite not only deals physical damage but also channels necrotic and lightning energies, making it extremely dangerous. The elemental damages increase with the user’s power, scaling similarly to a cantrip, ensuring the Fang remains a threat regardless of the wielder's level.
	> ##### Effects of the Fang
	> - You gain a bite attack that does 1d4 piercing, 1d4 necrotic, 1d4 lighting. This damage scales like a cantrip. 
	> - For each fang you are attuned to, your damage dice for the attack increases by 1 size to a maximum of 1d12. 
	
   **Quantities and Effects**: There are 78 Fangs in existence. Cultists who wield more than one Fang can alternate between them or even dual-wield in close combat. Each additional Fang increases the potency of the elemental effects, leading to devastating combined attacks. However, this power comes at a cost, as the necrotic energy begins to corrupt the user, causing physical mutations and a craving for violence.

4. **The Eye**: Perhaps the most feared and revered of Syllanaxen’s parts, the Eye represents his omniscience and dark vision. Possession of an Eye grants supernatural sight, allowing the user to see in complete darkness and perceive things beyond normal mortal capacity. Enhanced perception and initiative make the Eye a tool of foresight and strategy, allowing cult leaders to outmaneuver their enemies with ease.
	> ##### Effects of the Eye
	> Gives the user advantage on perception checks, advantage on inititave checks, and allows them to see in pure darkness as if it was bright light.

   **Quantities and Effects**: With only 7 Eyes available, they are the rarest and most valuable parts of Syllanaxen. Eyes are typically reserved for high-ranking cult leaders, serving as symbols of status and power. Those who possess an Eye are regarded as Syllanaxen’s chosen, often becoming prophets or commanders within the cult. Having multiple Eyes is unheard of, as the power and insight they grant could drive even the strongest minds to insanity, seeing beyond the veil of reality into realms of chaos and void.

### **Attunement Process and the Syllanaxen Connection Device (SCD)**

To wield the power of Syllanaxen’s parts, cult members must undergo a ritualistic surgery to implant a Syllanaxen Connection Device (SCD). This ritual, led by a cult leader, involves a painful procedure where the stomach is cut open, and the SCD is placed inside the body. The SCD serves as a conduit, connecting the cultist’s life force to the dark energies of Syllanaxen’s parts. This act of implantation is seen as a rite of passage, a rebirth into Syllanaxen’s dark service, marking the cultist as a true follower.

The SCD takes up one of the user’s attunement slots, representing the profound bond between the cultist and the dark god. Once implanted, the user can begin to attune to the parts of Syllanaxen they find or are given, provided their Constitution score can bear the cost. Each part requires a certain amount of Constitution to wield:

- **Claw**: 2 Constitution points
- **Fang**: 5 Constitution points
- **Eye**: 10 Constitution points
- **Scale**: 5 Constitution points

Cultists must carefully balance their desire for power with the physical toll it takes. Overloading their SCD with too many parts can lead to physical deterioration, madness, or death. The parts must be embedded into the cultist’s body, creating a grotesque and monstrous appearance. Arcane links connect each part to the SCD, allowing the cultist to channel Syllanaxen’s power.

### **Major Cult Leaders and the Distribution of Parts**

#### **High Prophet Vashra**
Vashra, known as the High Prophet, is the supreme leader of the Cult of Syllanaxen. She is believed to have visions directly from Syllanaxen, guiding the cult’s actions. Vashra possesses one of the Eyes, granting her unparalleled insight and strategic acumen. Her presence is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, her eyes glowing with an unnatural light that sees through lies and deception. Under her command, the cult has grown in power and influence, orchestrating attacks that have plunged entire regions into chaos.

#### **Harbinger Torvash**
Torvash, a former warrior turned cultist, is one of the most feared enforcers of the cult. Possessing multiple Claws and Fangs, Torvash is a living embodiment of Syllanaxen’s wrath. His body is covered in the grotesque marks of his attunement, with claws protruding from his arms and fangs replacing his teeth. He leads a band of cultists known as the Red Talons, who specialize in assassination and terror tactics. Torvash’s brutality is matched only by his loyalty to the High Prophet.

#### **Seeress Malindra**
Malindra, a mysterious figure within the cult, serves as the Seeress. Possessing two Eyes, she is said to have glimpsed the true nature of the universe, a sight that has left her both enlightened and maddened. Malindra is responsible for interpreting the will of Syllanaxen, using her sight to guide the cult’s rituals and prophecies. Her eyes are her most distinctive feature, glowing with an eerie luminescence, capable of seeing through both physical and magical darkness.

#### **The Scaled Ones**
A group of cultists known as the Scaled Ones serves as the primary defense force for the cult’s hidden sanctuaries. Each member possesses several Scales, granting them immense durability and resistance to damage. They are led by Commander Zathros, a hulking figure covered in thick scales, making him nearly invulnerable in battle. The Scaled Ones are fanatically loyal, trained to defend the cult’s secrets with their lives.

### **Current State of the Parts**

Given their rarity and power, the parts of Syllanaxen are highly sought after, not just by the cult but also by those who oppose them. Many parts remain unaccounted for, hidden in ancient ruins, lost temples, or guarded by powerful beings who know of their dark origins.

- **Eyes**: 5 of the 7 Eyes are currently in use by cult leaders. The remaining 2 are rumored to be hidden in forgotten temples, awaiting discovery.
- **Claws**: 15 of the 20 Claws are in use by various cult enforcers and assassins. The remaining 5 are held in reserve by the cult, used to reward those who prove their loyalty or for high-priority missions.
- **Fangs**: 60 of the 78 Fangs are actively used, with the remaining 18 are stored for future use.
- **Scales**: Approximately 200 of the 250 Scales are distributed among the Scaled Ones and other cult defenders. The rest are kept in secure locations, reserved for new initiates or replacing lost Scales.

### **Conclusion**

The Cult of Syllanaxen, with its dark rituals, powerful artifacts, and fanatical leaders, poses a significant threat to the world. Each part of Syllanaxen not only grants formidable abilities but also binds its user to the dark god’s will, turning them into instruments of chaos and destruction. The cult’s ultimate goal, to reunite Syllanaxen’s body and bring about his return, drives their every action, making them relentless in their pursuit of power.
